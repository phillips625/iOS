 An Introduction to iOS 8 Sprite Kit Programming
 If you have ever had an idea for a game, but didnâ€™t create it because you lacked the skills or time to write complex game code and logic, then look no further than Sprite Kit. Introduced as part of the iOS 8 SDK, Sprite Kit provides a way for 2D games to be developed with relative ease.
 Sprite Kit provides just about everything needed to create 2D games for iOS and Mac OS X with a minimum amount of coding. Some of the features provided by Sprite Kit include animation, physics, collision detection and special effects. Most of these features can be harnessed within a game with just a few method calls.
 
 
 Sprite Kit provides a platform for the creation of 2D games on iOS and Mac OS X. Games are comprised of an SKView instance with an SKScene object for each scene of the game. Scenes contain nodes that represent the characters, objects and items in the game. A variety of node types are available, all of which are subclassed from the SKNode class. Each node can have associated with it a physics body in the form of an SKPhysicsBody instance. A node with a physics body will be subject to physical forces such as gravity and, when given a physical boundary, collisions with other nodes may also be detected. Actions are configured using the SKAction class, instances of which are then run by the nodes on which the action is to be performed.
 The orientation and movement of a node can be restricted through the implementation of constraints using the SKConstraint class.
 The rendering of a Sprite Kit game takes place within the game loop with one loop being performed for each frame of the game. At a variety of points in this loop, the application will be given the opportunity to perform tasks as needed to implement and manage the underlying game logic.
 Having provided a high level overview in this chapter, the next three chapters will take a more practical approach to exploring the capabilities of Sprite Kit through the creation of a simple game.
